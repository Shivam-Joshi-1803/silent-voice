🧏‍ Silent Voice

Silent Voice is an AI-powered, two-way communication system that bridges the gap between the deaf/mute community and the hearing world. It translates Indian Sign Language (ISL) into text and speech, and also converts spoken words into ISL, making communication seamless and accessible.

⚠️ Note: This project is currently under the patent process. As a result, the full source code is not publicly available at this time.

🚀 Features
🔤 ISL to Text/Speech: Real-time gesture recognition and conversion using computer vision and deep learning.

🗣️ Speech to ISL: Converts voice input to Indian Sign Language gestures using animation or visual indicators.

🧠 Custom-Trained Models: Built and trained on a dataset of ISL gestures for accurate classification.

🎯 User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for both hearing and non-hearing users.

🔄 Two-Way Communication: Enables natural interaction between users regardless of hearing ability.

🧪 How It Works (Overview Only)
Due to the patenting process, we can only provide a high-level overview of how Silent Voice operates:
1)Sign to Text/Speech
Captures hand gestures via webcam.
Uses computer vision and trained AI models for classification.
Outputs translated speech/text for real-time communication.
2)Speech to Sign
Captures spoken language via microphone.
Translates to ISL format using a dynamic visual system.
