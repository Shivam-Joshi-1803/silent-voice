⚠️ Note:
This project is currently undergoing a patent application. Due to intellectual property protection, the full source code is temporarily withheld from public access. A demo and technical overview are provided below for understanding the concept and capabilities.

🔥 Key Highlights
✋ ISL to Text & Speech
Uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize hand gestures and convert them into real-time text and audio output.

🎙️ Speech to ISL
Translates spoken words into Indian Sign Language using animated visuals for two-way communication.

🧠 Custom AI Models
Trained on a dedicated ISL dataset for accurate and responsive gesture classification.

🌐 User-Friendly Interface
Accessible design for both hearing and non-hearing users with a focus on simplicity and usability.

🧠 How It Works (Overview)

🖐️ Gesture Recognition

- Captures hand signs via webcam
- Uses OpenCV + MediaPipe for landmark detection
- Predicts meaning using a custom-trained CNN model

🔊 Speech Recognition

- Captures user voice via microphone
- Transcribes speech using NLP libraries
- Displays ISL sign equivalents via animations or image renderings
